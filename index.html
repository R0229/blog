        <p>My name is Dan Dong, or 'Recho' in the English community. 
            Over my self growth, I am constantly obsessed with novel designs, discoveries and expressions I came across, like the beautiful novels, poems, research articles, cloth designs and wise words from bralliant human-beings. I am never tired of raw, fresh ideas, and discovery. I love changes and unexpectations. They shape me too. I used to trying to fit myself into others until I have to admit that I am different. Now I am a researcher at work and a thinker at life. </p>
